How to contact Nate Goldman on the internet, in order of preference.

#### 1. Make an [issue][message-url]

[![message][message-img]][message-url]

You can start a conversation by creating an issue in this repository's [issue tracker](../../issues).

You can also send me a **private message** using PGP encryption. This is relatively easy using [keybase](https://keybase.io/). My keybase username is [ngoldman](https://keybase.io/ngoldman).

#### 3. Chat with me on [IRC][irc-url]

[![irc][irc-img]][irc-url]

I'm `ngoldman` on [freenode IRC](https://freenode.net/). I'm almost always in [#pdxtech](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pdxtech), [#pdxnode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pdxnode), and [#codeforportland](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=codeforportland). It may take a long time for me to respond as I'm not always actually there (I use an [IRC bouncer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_(software)) to stay on IRC indefinitely).

#### 4. Burden me with [email][email-url]

[![tweet][email-img]][email-url]

**Fair warning:** email is my least favorite form of communication. I get a lot of it and it often takes a while before I can respond. The longer the email, the longer it will take for me to answer it. Please only email me if you really need to.

#### 5. Watch [Contact][contact-url]

[![contact][contact-img]][contact-url]

**Contact** (1997), starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey, is a pretty good movie. It's based on a book by [Carl Sagan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan), who was a pretty neat guy. Watching it is not a reliable method for contacting me but I still recommend it if you get a chance.
