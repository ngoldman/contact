How to contact me *(in order of preference)*

#### 1. Make an [issue][message-url]

[![message][message-img]][message-url]

You can send me a **private message** using PGP encryption. This is relatively easy using [keybase](https://keybase.io/). My keybase username is [`ngoldman`](https://keybase.io/ngoldman).

#### 3. Send me an [email][email-url]

**Fair warning:** email is my least favorite form of communication. I get a lot of it and it often takes a while before I will respond to it. There is also an exponential correlation between email length and response time (the longer the email, the longer the response time). Please only email me if you have to.

#### 4. Watch Contact

[![contact][contact-img]][contact-url]

**Contact** (1997), starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey, is a pretty good movie. It's based on a book by [Carl Sagan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan), who was a pretty neat guy. Watching it is not a reliable method for contacting me but I still recommend it if you get a chance.
